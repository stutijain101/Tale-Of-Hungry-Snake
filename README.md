The "Tale of Hungry Snake" is a modern rendition of the classic Snake game. This browser-based game allows players to control a snake, guiding it to eat food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself. The game provides an engaging experience with a simple yet effective design, enhanced with sound effects and score tracking.





## Features

- Snake Movement: The snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, right) using the arrow keys.
- Food Consumption: When the snake eats food, it grows longer, and a new piece of food appears randomly on the board.
- Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself, with an alert prompt to restart the game.
- Score Tracking: The player's score increases each time the snake eats food. The high score is stored in the browser's local storage and displayed on the screen.
- Sound Effects: The game includes sound effects for eating food, moving, and game over events, enhancing the gameplay experience.
